Ayanna Narrow Font
===================

Ayanna, is a slightly narrow font intended for titles and short texts and quotes in the web, with Sinhala Tamil and Latin support.
This project was initiated as a benchmark project that can be used as a starting point for many other Sinhala type design projects. And the name ‘Ayanna’ stands for the start since ‘Ayanna’ අ is the first letter of the Sinhala alphabet. The font has grown from this favourable plateau to be recognized as an overall widely used allrounder for the various purposes of printing and web industry.

With a slightly narrow forms, Ayanna will give you a slight introspective nature with its ingredients. With Tamil and Latin glyph sets, the font provides a complete solution for Sinhala Tamil and English trilingual design. Ayanna, vertically extended and horizontally packed, hence present you the low space consumerism. Ayanna Sinhala has its peculiarities and experimental shapes that make it perform well as a display face while belonging in the formal category of fonts. Make sure you check out all these features before using it.

Ayanna Latin glyph set is intended to be a companion to Ayanna Sinhala, harmonizing  in proportions and style. It is slightly condensed and proportions seek to gain space in height and width. The x-height is generous and it has short ascenders and descenders.
It has a neutral design style with a warm touch of soft and smooth curves. Ayanna is offered in four styles, and the extra light weight is pleasingly graceful and stylish for headlines.

The project was funded by Google, being led by Mooniak, a collaborative collective of designers based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Sinhala designed by Rajitha Manamperi, Tamil designed by Kosala Senevirathne, and Latin by Sol Matas. Pathum Egodawatta and Ayantha Randika and contributed to the project in consulting, managing and Opentype engineering.See [Milestones](https://github.com/mooniak/ayanna-narrow/milestones)

අඩුවෙන් ඉඩ අයත්කරගන්නා, අන්තර්ගතයන්ට මෙන්ම අභිධානයන්ටද එකලෙස යෙදිය හැකි සිංහල දෙමළ මෙන්ම ඉංග්‍රීසි භාෂාවේ අකුරු වලිනුත් සමන්විත ‘අයන්න’ ශ්‍රී ලාංකීය ජාතියේ උන්නතිය අරමුණු කොටගෙන ඔබේ අත්ලට පිරිනමන අපගේ අලුත්ම ෆොන්ට නිකුතුවයි.

- See `/fonts` in `gh-pages` branch contains draft fonts which are dirty, generated for design testing.
- See `/sources/` contains dirty and incomplete `.ufo` files which opens in all major font editors. These files are generated in intervals in between development. See [Realases](https://github.com/mooniak/ayanna-font/releases) for clean sources.
- See `/sources/sfd` contains source `.sfd` files which opens in [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/). These files are under active developemnt.

## How To Build

If you want your way around fonts and terminal, you can use our build system to fonts.To generate fonts we use a virtual enviromant created with Vagrant. See [WeliPilla](https://github.com/mooniak/WeliPilla) for more info.

Once you have Welipilla set up, do the following..

- Run Vagrant box, this will take a few minuits to set up the build enviroment.

```shell
$vagrant up
```

- SSH into vagrant box.(Use putty on Windows)
```shell
$vagrant ssh
```

- Run builder script.
```shell
$cd /vagrant/scripts && sh builder.sh
```
